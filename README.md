:gb: :point_right: :jp: I will translate random English articles for my fellow Japanese mates :muscle:

About this repository
---------------------

We all know that there are countless quality English articles out there accessible through the internet. I have been working on improving my English for the past 10 years. Although I will still need to continue working on it, I don't generally struggle much when reading English, unlike many other Japanese people might do. This is why I want to translate such articles into Japanese, my mother tongue, so that I can transfer good messages from great English writers to my fellow Japanese friends.

Articles
--------

I listed up some English articles I want to translate. Please note that not all the articles are must-read articles.
